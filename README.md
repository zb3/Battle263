# Battle263

Battleships extended version in Java. Yet another... That's it.

This is an university project... you know, I wouldn't choose Java especially for a game but...


## What's inside

Well, there should be a game.. a battleships one with:
* Sea and Land Pieces
* Aircraft carriers which can occupy both
* Ship editor
* Ability to save board to a file
* Random ship placement
* AI (albeit not the best grade)
* GUI (long live Swing!)
* 46 other requirements that I had to fullfill but didn't :D

## What's outside

Pretty much everything that is not inside I guess (not sure tho)

## FAQ

### How do I start this thing?
Are you sure you want to start this? Just saying... but if you are, then this should work:
```
$ git clone git://github.com/zb3/Battle263.git
$ java -jar Battle263/dist/Battle263.jar
```
Be careful with that though - this may set your computer on fire!

### That about box is amazing!
Thanks, this is indeed the best part of this project.

### Can I play with a friend?
If your friend is an AI then yes, but otherwise no. No time to implement it...

### Okay thanks
This is not a question.
